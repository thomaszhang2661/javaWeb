    <p>Caption:“I wanted to be in a place where I could have one foot in computer science and one foot in a top-notch behavioral economics department,” says Professor Sendhil Mullainathan. “And really, if you just objectively said what are the places that are A-plus in both, MIT is at the top of that list.”

    <p>Behavioral economist Sendhil Mullainathan has never forgotten the pleasure he felt the first time he tasted a delicious crisp, yet gooey Levain cookie. He compares the experience to when he encounters new ideas.</p>
    <p>“That hedonic pleasure is pretty much the same pleasure I get hearing a new idea, discovering a new way of looking at a situation, or thinking about something, getting stuck and then having a breakthrough. You get this kind of core basic reward,” says Mullainathan, the Peter de Florez Professor with dual appointments in the MIT departments of Economics and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and a principal investigator at the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).</p>
    <p>Mullainathan’s love of new ideas, and by extension of going beyond the usual interpretation of a situation or problem by looking at it from many different angles, seems to have started very early. As a child in school, he says, the multiple-choice answers on tests all seemed to offer possibilities for being correct. </p>
    <p>“They would say, ‘Here are three things. Which of these choices is the fourth?’ Well, I was like, ‘I don’t know.’ There are good explanations for all of them,” Mullainathan says. “While there’s a simple explanation that most people would pick, natively, I just saw things quite differently.”  </p>
    <p>Mullainathan says the way his mind works, and has always worked, is “out of phase” — that is, not in sync with how most people would readily pick the one correct answer on a test. He compares the way he thinks to “one of those videos where an army’s marching and one guy’s not in step, and everyone is thinking, what’s wrong with this guy?” </p>
